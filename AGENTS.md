The project is about porting onto a new Metatrader5 EA, a TradingView Strategy (see TradingView PropStrategy.txt for full script), coded in Pinescript.

EA skeleton comprises of 2 separate EAs, one (acting as Master) will be attached to the Prop MT5 account and will be triggering the trades and the second EA (slave) will be attached to the Hedge MT5 account and will open the opposite direction positions. 

Priority is to ensure absolute parity between TradingView PropStrategy and EA. Note ---> Pineconnector related code can be dropped, we dont need it anymore. 

Dashboard (below) needs to be cloned and code it in an .mqh. <img width="513" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-17 at 10 36 05 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9df3bb5-1849-4f24-b89a-5b969fcc9f1a" />

## Tasks
- Provide a compile helper script `scripts/compile.sh` that uses MetaEditor to
  compile both experts. The script defaults to `/Applications` for macOS users
  and accepts a custom path via the `METATRADER_PATH` variable or command-line
  argument.
